# WH40K-List-Builder

This is a personnal project but anyone can contribute.
The idea is to create a small software to manage a warhammer 40k army list.

I use this project to learn C++ and I may think of making it a mobile app in the future.

## What do I need to know in order to contribute ?

You don;t need to have any knowledge of warhammer 40k. The concept is quite simple :

You pick a race from a list.
Each race has formations.
Each formations contains units
Each units contains model
Each model has statistics and equipement

The user select a race and pick a formation, then add units and models to it and customise it.

## Improvement

- Use the real information to check that models are correctly equiped (ie. you can't equip whatever you want, there is rules )
- Do a the reverse process: I have models, the app tells me what formation I can select with maybe pros and cons
